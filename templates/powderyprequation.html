                    <p><h4>How to Prevent Powdery Mildew Infection</h4></p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.</li>
                        <li>Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.</li>
                        <li>Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground.</li>
                        <li>Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves.</li>
                        <li>Water in the morning, so plants have a chance to dry during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses will help keep the foliage dry.</li>
                        <li>Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible.</li>

                        <p>How to Treat Powdery Mildew Effectively to Get Rid of It
                        Milk Spray:Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days.
                        Baking Soda:Baking soda is one of the best home remedies for treating powdery mildew. For this method, 1ix 1 tablespoon baking soda and ½ teaspoon liquid soap in 1 gallon of water. Transfer it into a spray bottle and spray the tops and underside of leaves and any other affected areas.
                        Although this works best as a preventative measure, it’s also known to be effective on existing powdery mildew infections as well.
                        Wash Foliage:Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7-day schedule, will prevent a fungal attack on plants grown indoors.
                        Sulfur or Copper-Based Fungicide:Apply sulfur or copper-based fungicides to prevent infection of susceptible plants. For best results, apply early or at the first sign of disease. Spray all plant parts thoroughly and repeat at 7-10 day intervals up to the day of harvest.
                        Potassium Bicarbonate:Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate — commonly used in food products — that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection.At the first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. Monterey® BI-CARB is a similar product containing micro-encapsulated potassium bicarbonate as the active ingredient. Mix 4 teaspoons in 2 gallons of water to thoroughly cover foliage.
                        Broad-Spectrum Fungicide:Effectively treat fungal diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad-spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is approved for organic gardening. Best of all, it’s safe to use — you can treat and pick crops on the same day!
                        Sulfur Burner for Indoor Plants:Indoor growers may want to consider using a Sulfur Burner/ Vaporizer which turns sulfur prills into fine dust and changes the pH of leaf surfaces.Fungal spores and mold can’t get established on this plant coating. As an added benefit, studies have shown that this dust will eliminate spider mites.</p>
