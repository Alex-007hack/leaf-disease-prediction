                    <p> Treatment for rust fungus
                        Inspect your plants frequently, especially at the base of the leaves near the soil. If you find symptoms of rust, you can remove the leaf that it appears on. Don’t remove more than 1/3 of the leaves at one time. Once you find rust in a vulnerable species, you will need to treat it to save that plant and others of the same species in your landscape.
                       Chemical treatments
                       Chemical fungicides should be used in early spring right when new growth appears on the plant or in the fall after leaf drop. Fungicides are not effective after rust symptoms appear. Chemical fungicides have to be repeated every 4-5 weeks while the temperature and moisture are conducive to the fungus. After the weather warms up, rust cannot reproduce even if it is present in the plant, so you can stop the treatments.
                       Preventing Rust Fungus
                       It is very difficult to prevent rust fungus in your garden because it appears in such a wide variety of plants. 
                       Buy rust-resistant cultivars:When possible, however, you should buy rust-resistant cultivars. Be sure you look for those in seed catalogs. 
                       Check plants before bringing them home:Only buy plants from a local and reputable nursery.  Before buying a plant at a nursery, check under the leaves of the plant and around the base of it.
                       Quarantine New Plants:Even if you do not see any spots on a plant at the nursery, it is a good idea to quarantine new plants for two weeks before placing them in your landscape.
                       How to water plants to prevent rust fungus?
                       Rust fungus must sit on a wet leaf for 6-10 hours before it can infect a plant. Do not use overhead watering to water a plant. Water using drip irrigation or other methods that do not wet the plant leaves, only the roots. Soil splashing up on leaves during watering is a major method of infection.
                       Sometimes you can’t help but use a sprinkler system. If you must water overhead, do so from 5-10 A.M. so the leaves dry before nightfall.
                       Dispose of infected plants and plant parts properly:Never compost a plant with any disease or pest problem. The problem will be introduced into your compost. When you spread the compost, you spread the disease throughout your landscape.Put infected plants and leaves into a plastic bag. Seal it well and put it in the trash. That way, the spores cannot spread to other plants.
                       Fall Clean-Up:Make sure you clean up leaves and other dead plant parts from your landscape beds each fall. If you have rust-affected plants, cut them to the ground at the end of the season and remove them from your landscape beds. Rust overwinters on leaves and removing them can cut the rust cycle off. Be sure and do not compost the leaves if your plants have had rust. Dispose of them in plastic bags and put those in the trash.
                       Remove Alternate Host Plants:In the example of wheat stem rust discussed above, farmers who removed barberry plants saw a drop in rust on their wheat the year following the barberry cull. If you have a rust problem and the rust uses two hosts, remove the less desirable of the two hosts to control the rust problem. This doesn’t work if the rust species you have only uses one host.
                       Hot Water:Because rust can only exist in such a narrow temperature band, hot water kills some types of rust. An example is geranium rust (Puccinia Pelargonii-zones). However, the hot water does some damage to the plant, also.
                       Wash Tools and Shoes:Rust usually disburses in the wind. However, if you have a plant with rust, make sure you wash your tools and shoes before moving on to the next plant. Spores are tiny and can hitch a ride on your shoes and tools to your other plants. Wash tools in a solution on one part bleach and nine parts water. There are disinfectant solutions you can step in to kill pathogens like rust on your shoes.</p>
